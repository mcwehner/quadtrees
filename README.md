## quadtrees

A growing collection of code fragments involving quadtrees.


### canvas_renderer

Draw a region quadtree by clicking and dragging the mouse. The region quadtree
grows dynamically as needed, and is rendered using an HTML5 `canvas` element.

The quadtree generation and traversal algorithm I've written for this is very
fast (realtime).

A more thorough exploration of the code will be added soon, describing the
algorithm being used, and the supporting classes that have been implemented.
